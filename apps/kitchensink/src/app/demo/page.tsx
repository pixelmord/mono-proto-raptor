            One of the primary benefits of visual planning is that it enhances creativity. When individuals engage in
            visual planning, they are encouraged to think visually and creatively. This approach allows them to explore
            different options and ideas that they may not have considered before. Visual planning stimulates the right
            side of the brain, which is responsible for creativity, imagination, and intuition. By tapping into this
            part of the brain, individuals can come up with innovative solutions to problems and challenges.
